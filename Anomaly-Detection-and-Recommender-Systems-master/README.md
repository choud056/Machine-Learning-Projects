# Anomaly Detection & Recommender Systems : Machine Learning Coursera Project

This repository contains python code for implementation of anomaly detection and recommender systems.

In **Anomaly Detection**, I used the training data to find statistics of the data (mean and variance) and used them to find the 
probability distribution function (pdf) of the cross validation data sets. I declared datapoints whose pdf is less than a small
value (epsilon) to be anomalies (outliers)

In **Recommender Systems** I implemented collaborative filtering learning algorithm to provides ratings to the movies.
